This is a simple packet logger for libip_udp. To use it, do the following at
the terminal where you want the packets to get logged from and do:

$ export LOG_PACKETS=1

So to log all packets, you have to do this at both the server and the client.
Then start the logger, it will log to stdout:

$ ./simplelog

BIG WARNING

There might be something wrong with the order of the packets. We are
investigating it.
